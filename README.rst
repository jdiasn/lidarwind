juplidarSuit is an open-source python project to retrieve wind speed and direction profiles from Doppler lidar observations from the WindCube-200s, and it was developed to be easy to use. It can retrieve wind profiles from the 6-beam and DBS scanning strategies and allow users to set the signal-to-noise ratio threshold to reduce the noise. It also calculates the Reynolds stress tensor matrix elements from the 6-beam observations.

luidarSuit is a result of an effort to create an environment where it would be flexible and easy to process the observations from the WindCube Doppler lidar. Its development started in 2021 when I had to retrieve wind profiles from the 6-beam observations.

This current version focuses on the WindCube's observations, and the wind retrievals are dedicated to the 6-bean and DBS observations. However, it can be expanded to other Doppler lidar observations and scanning strategies.
